📘 My HTML Notes

Hey! 👋
This repo has all the notes and practice files I made while learning HTML for the very first time.
It’s basically my learning journey, so it might look simple, but it covers all the basics I went through.

📝 What’s Inside?

Basic structure of an HTML page

Headings, paragraphs & text formatting

Lists (ordered & unordered)

Links, images, audio, video

Tables & forms

Semantic tags (header, footer, section, etc.)

Some random experiments I did while practicing 😅



🎯 Why I Made This

To keep track of my learning 📚

As a quick reference when I forget something

To have a starting point before moving on to CSS and JavaScript

🌟 What’s Next?

Add CSS notes (to make things look better 😎)

Later, start with JavaScript basics

Maybe try some small projects using HTML + CSS
